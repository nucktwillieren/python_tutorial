Setup 1: initialize a array "a"
Setup 2: initialize a number "n"
Step 1: Get remainder from the number "n" by dividing by 2 and store the remainder in array "a"
Step 2: Divide the number "n" by 2 through / (division operator)
Step 3: Repeat the step 2 until number is greater than 0

Example: 
    input a number "n" = 3
    the array "a" = [1, 1]

Analysis:
    Time Complexity = O(n)
